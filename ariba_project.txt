Ariba WAF – Full Project with Control Dashboard
Project Overview

Ariba WAF is a Web Application Firewall built using the Tornado Python framework. It protects web applications by inspecting HTTP/HTTPS requests, detecting malicious traffic, and blocking attacks such as SQL Injection, XSS, RFI, and more. The project includes a web-based control dashboard for real-time monitoring, management, and analytics.

1. Project Features
1.1 Core WAF Features

Request inspection: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE.

Detection of common web attacks:

SQL Injection

XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)

RFI/LFI (Remote/Local File Inclusion)

Command Injection

Blocking malicious requests (403 Forbidden or redirect to warning page).

Customizable security rules using regex or predefined patterns.

IP-based whitelisting/blacklisting.

Rate limiting per IP or endpoint.

Logging requests (allowed and blocked) with details: timestamp, IP, payload, headers.

1.2 Advanced Features

HTTPS support with SSL termination.

Configurable backend servers (reverse proxy).

Dashboard for control and monitoring.

Export logs in CSV/JSON format.

Optional alert notifications for suspicious activities.

Dashboard modules:

Live traffic monitor

Threat map

Attack statistics

Rule management (add/remove/update rules)

IP whitelist/blacklist management

Rate limiting settings

Modules

Request Handler Module

Intercepts HTTP/HTTPS requests.

Sends requests to Security Engine for inspection.

Security Engine Module

Matches requests against attack patterns.

Applies rate-limiting and IP filtering.

Returns “block” or “allow” decision.

Forwarding Module

Forwards allowed requests to backend server.

Handles response and returns to client.

Logging Module

Logs all requests and WAF actions.

Supports database storage (SQLite/PostgreSQL).

Dashboard Module

Web interface for administrators.

Shows live traffic, blocked attacks, statistics.

Allows rule, IP, and rate-limit management.

Configuration Module

Stores settings: rules, whitelist, blacklist, rate limits.

Supports dynamic updates without restarting WAF.

3. Technology Stack

Backend: Python Tornado (async)

Frontend/Dashboard: Tornado templates + Bootstrap / TailwindCSS

Database: SQLite (small) / PostgreSQL (production)

Logging: File-based or database

Deployment: Linux server / Docker

Optional: Redis for rate-limiting and caching

4. Development Roadmap (Step by Step)
Phase 1: Core WAF

Setup Tornado project.

Create Request Handler module.

Implement basic security engine (regex detection for SQLi/XSS).

Forward safe requests to backend server.

Log allowed/blocked requests.

Phase 2: Advanced Security

Add IP whitelist/blacklist.

Add rate-limiting per IP/endpoint.

Add HTTPS support.

Implement configuration module for rules management.

Phase 3: Dashboard

Build Tornado web dashboard.

Display live traffic and blocked requests.

Add modules for:

Rule management

IP management

Rate-limiting settings

Implement logs visualization and export.

Phase 4: Optional Enhancements

Real-time alerting (email/Slack).

Threat map visualization.

AI/ML-based anomaly detection.

Dockerize project for easy deployment.

5. Benefits of Ariba WAF

Full-featured WAF with dashboard control.

Lightweight and high-performance due to Tornado.

Easily deployable and scalable.

Customizable security rules for enterprise needs.

Logs, statistics, and live monitoring for admins.
